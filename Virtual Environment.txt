If you use a windows machine (I use a Windows 10) do the following to activate a virtual environment

D:\workspace> python -m venv project-one

D:\workspace> cd project-one

D:\workspace\project-one> Scripts\activate

(project-one) D:\workspace\project-one> # you should see your virtual environment folder name in brackets at the start of every line in the command prompt. This indicates that your virtual environment is now active

To deactivate

(project-one) D:\workspace\project-one> deactivate
